Developed a Python-based facial recognition project utilizing computer vision techniques to detect and identify registered faces in real-time. The system scans faces, matches them against a database of known individuals, and accurately identifies registered users or flags unknown persons. Implemented using libraries such as OpenCV and face_recognition, showcasing skills in image processing, machine learning, and Python programming.
